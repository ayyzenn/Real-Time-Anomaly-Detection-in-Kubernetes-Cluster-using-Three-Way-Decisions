# Final Year Project Repository

This repository contains all the code and documentation related to our final year project. The repository is organized into two main branches:

## Branches

### Main Branch (`main`)

The `main` branch contains the finalized code that represents the complete and polished version of our project. This branch is intended to be the stable and production-ready version of our work.

### Development Branch (`all`)

The `all` branch contains all the work and development efforts that have been carried out over the past year. This includes experiments, prototypes, intermediate commits, and additional documentation that provide a comprehensive view of our project's evolution.

## Project Overview

- **Main Branch**: Finalized and stable project code.
- **All Branch**: Comprehensive development history and all related work.

We hope this structure helps in understanding the development process and the final outcome of our project.
